# Problem Statement
The performance of vendors has a significant impact on overall efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and 
quality of the goods and services delivered. As a result, managing vendor performance has become a 
critical component of business strategy. Traditional methods of evaluating vendor performance are 
often insufficient to provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of vendor performance 
since they do not consider real time data or provide any insight into future trends or patterns.
