# The Data Pipeline (ETL)
The performance of vendors has a significant impact on overall efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and 
quality of the goods and services delivered. As a result, managing vendor performance has become a 
critical component of business strategy. 

I engineered an automated pipeline to transform raw, messy transactional data into a single source of truth *(Automated ingestion and SQL transformation)*. The data pipipeline ensures to identify profitability leaks across a diverse retail inventory. 

I conducted a statistical deep dive which integrates sales and purchasing data  via *Python and SQL* and revealed a critical margin-volume paradox.
By validating findings through hypothesis testing, top-performing vendors achieved a mean profit margin of 31.17% and te low-volume vendors achieved a significantly higher mean margin of 41.55%.
